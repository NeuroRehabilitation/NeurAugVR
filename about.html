                  <h4>Bio</h4>
                  <p>
                    I received my Msc. in telecommunications engineering from
                    the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC) and a PhD
                    from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich
                    (ETHZ).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have pursued research at several institutes in Europe and
                    the USA, including the Laboratoire de Production
                    Microtechnique at the EPFL (Lausanne), the Institute of
                    Neuroinformatics at the ETHZ (Zurich), at the Institute of
                    Audiovisual Studies at the Tecnology Department of the
                    Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona), where I was a Juan de
                    la Cierva research fellow and head of the Robotic Systems
                    Laboratory at the laboratory for Synthetic Perceptive,
                    Emotive and Cognitive Systems (SPECS), and the Quality of
                    Life Technologies and Entertainment technology centers of
                    the Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since 2006, I am an active researcher in the Virtual
                    Rehabilitation field. Since I arrived in Madeira in 2010, I
                    established an interdisciplinary research group with approx.
                    15 members including engineers, psychologists, and
                    occupational therapists that addresses the use of
                    interactive technologies, VR and Brain Computer Interfaces
                    in the rehabilitation post-stroke and dementia. While in
                    Madeira, I have been awarded 6 projects as PI in the field
                    of virtual rehabilitation through national and European
                    competitive calls. My work has been published over 140 times
                    in international peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and
                    book chapters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently, I am an Associate Professor (tenure) at the
                    University of Madeira in Portugal where I coordinate the
                    NeuroRehabLab research group (<a
                      href="https://neurorehablab.arditi.pt/"
                      >https://neurorehablab.arditi.pt/</a
                    >) and the International Master Program on Interactive Media
                    Design (<a href="http://mdmi.uma.pt/">http://mdmi.uma.pt/</a
                    >). Also, I am associate editor of the journal of
                    NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation. Currently, I am
                    finishing my mandate as President of the International
                    Society for Virtual Rehabilitation for the 2018-2020 period.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h4>Research interests</h4>
                  <p>
                    I am interested in imaging human brain function
                    noninvasively, by exploiting the wonderful versatility and
                    never-ending possibilities of magnetic resonance imaging
                    (MRI), and by combining this with the highly complementary
                    technique of electroencephalography (EEG) whenever
                    appropriate. In one line of research, I seek to obtain more
                    quantitative measures of brain function by evaluating the
                    underlying cerebrovascular dynamics through the integration
                    of multiple MRI techniques, including imaging of tissue
                    perfusion, cerebrovascular reactivity, and blood
                    oxygenation. Another line of research involves the
                    combination of EEG with functional MRI, with the aim of
                    assessing the spatial-temporal dynamics of brain networks.
                    Overall, I expect that these developments will help
                    elucidate the investigation of brain function, in healthy
                    individuals as well as in patients suffering from
                    neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, I hope
                    to leverage the insights obtained from brain imaging to
                    improve noninvasive neuromodulation techniques aimed at
                    repairing brain function, particularly through neurofeedback
                    training. Specifically, I have been focused on applications
                    in the paroxysmal disorders of epilepsy and migraine, in
                    cerebrovascular diseases associated with dementia, and also
                    in schizophrenia and depression.

                  <h4>Bio</h4>
                  <p>
                    I graduated in Physics and Engineering from Instituto
                    Superior Técnico (IST) at the Technical University of Lisbon
                    in 1997, and subsequently completed the post-graduation in
                    Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering at the Faculty of
                    Sciences of the University of Lisbon, and obtained the
                    D.Phil. degree in Neuroimaging from the University of
                    Oxford, where I worked with Prof. Peter Jezzard at the
                    Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the
                    Brain (FMRIB), in 2003. I was then invited lecturer at
                    Thammasat University, in Thailand, before returning to
                    Portugal in 2004 as postdoctoral researcher at the Institute
                    for Biomedical Imaging and Life Sciences (IBILI), of the
                    Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra. I joined
                    IST as Assistant Professor in 2007, I was conferred
                    habilitation in Biomedical Engineering by the same school in
                    2017, and I am currently Associate Professor with the
                    Department of Bioengineering at IST, University of Lisbon. I
                    am also the coordinator of the Evolutionary Systems and
                    Biomedical Engineering Lab (LaSEEB) of the Institute for
                    Systems and Robotics, Lisboa (ISR-Lisboa). I have been
                    Honorary Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Neurology,
                    University College London, and Visting Scientist at the
                    École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

                  <p>
                    During the past ten years, I have been responsible and
                    participated in several national and international research
                    projects in brain imaging, neuroscience and biomedical
                    engineering, and I have been the author of over 40 papers in
                    international journals of high impact in these fields. My
                    work has been distinguished with the Prize for Women in
                    Science by L’Oréal Portugal, the 2nd best paper award by the
                    Portuguese League against Epilepsy, and the António Xavier
                    Prize for the best Portuguese PhD Thesis (as advisor) in
                    NMR, EPR or MRI. I have (co-)supervised 11 PhD theses (6
                    completed) and more than 20 MSc theses. I have also been the
                    vice-coordinator of the MSc programme in Biomedical
                    Engineering at IST, where I am responsible for teaching
                    graduate courses in Medical Imaging, Neuroimaging and
                    Neuroengineering. Moreover, I participate in academic
                    management activities within the university, including the
                    Executive Committee of the Department of Bioengineering of
                    IST, the Scientific Council of IST, and the Scientific
                    Committee of ISR-Lisboa. Internationally, I have been
                    actively involved with the European Society for Magnetic
                    Resonance in Medicine and Biology (ESMRMB) as a member of
                    its Education Committee, and am currently member of the
                    Executive Committee and elected Chair of the Congress
                    Planning Committee for the 2021 ESMRMB Annual Meeting.

                  <p>
                    I am interested in imaging human brain function
                    noninvasively, by exploiting the wonderful versatility and
                    never-ending possibilities of magnetic resonance imaging
                    (MRI), and by combining this with the highly complementary
                    technique of electroencephalography (EEG) whenever
                    appropriate. In one line of research, I seek to obtain more
                    quantitative measures of brain function by evaluating the
                    underlying cerebrovascular dynamics through the integration
                    of multiple MRI techniques, including imaging of tissue
                    perfusion, cerebrovascular reactivity, and blood
                    oxygenation. Another line of research involves the
                    combination of EEG with functional MRI, with the aim of
                    assessing the spatial-temporal dynamics of brain networks.
                    Overall, I expect that these developments will help
                    elucidate the investigation of brain function, in healthy
                    individuals as well as in patients suffering from
                    neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, I hope
                    to leverage the insights obtained from brain imaging to
                    improve noninvasive neuromodulation techniques aimed at
                    repairing brain function, particularly through neurofeedback
                    training. Specifically, I have been focused on applications
                    in the paroxysmal disorders of epilepsy and migraine, in
                    cerebrovascular diseases associated with dementia, and also
                    in schizophrenia and depression.

                    I graduated in 2011 with an integrated Master´s Degree in
                    Medicine from the University of Lisbon. I did my Master´s
                    project under Professor Fernando Lopes da Silva on the
                    applications of Brain Computer Interfaces for patients with
                    severe motors dysfunction. I did my general medical
                    rotations known collectively in Portugal as the ano comum in
                    2012. I specialized in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
                    between 2013 and 2017, training at the Central Hospital of
                    Funchal, University Hospital Centre of Central Lisbon,
                    Beatriz ngelo Hospital (Loures), Santo António Hospital
                    (Porto) and the North Rehabilitation Centre (Gaia). I worked
                    between 2018 and 2019 as a specialist in Physical Medicine
                    and rehabilitation Medicine at the Central Hospital of
                    Funchal and have returned to this role in 2021. In 2020 I
                    did a fellowship in acquired Brain Injury rehabilitation at

                    I graduated in Biomedical Engineering, at the Faculty of
                    Engineering of the University of Porto. While there, I
                    published my first paper about a saxophone mouthpiece, able
                    to describe the performance of a player. I soon was drawn to
                    neuroscience, and I completed my thesis on the analysis of
                    dendritic spines from confocal microscopy images, in
                    partnership with i3S and King's College London. I then

                    recipient of the Doctoral Conacyt scholarship (reference
                    424423), researching about Pain detection in healthy
                    subjects with EEG analysis oriented to non-communicative
                    patients, with an Internship with COMA Science Group (Liège,
                    Belgium) to analyze EEG in non-communicative patients in
                    resting state. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at
                    NeurorehabLab working on Motor Rehabilitation using Brain
                    Interface Computer and Virtual Reality (BCI - VR) with
                    Stroke Survivors under the NeurAugVR FCT project
                    (PTDC/CCI-COM/31485/2017), participating in International
                    Congresses as ICVR in 2019, SMC in 2019, and BIOSTEC in
                    2021. Besides, I have been awarded twice under the Incoming
                    mobility BOF program, in 2018 and 2020, to look for
                    synergies with the REVAL group of Hasselt University, with
                    an impact on the development of bimanual strategies for
                    stroke neurorehabilitation.

                  <h4>Research interests</h4>
                  <p>
                    My main interest is learning about brain functioning and
                    neuroplasticity to improve quality of life; disentangling
                    functional processes, and helping in recovery. In
                    particular, I am interested to learn about brain dynamics
                    across time. Besides, I am interested in research with
                    multimodal neuroimaging analysis and neurophysiological
                    signals that can help to unravel brain processes, acquiring
                    different points of view based on the physical principles of
                    the devices.

                  <p>
                    I got my bachelor’s degree in Occupational Therapy at Escola
                    Superior de Saúde in Porto (ESS, Politécnico do Porto). I’ve
                    worked as an Occupational Therapist (OT) in different
                    fields, focusing my experience working with the adult
                    population and the elderly. I’ve become a member of
                    NeuroRehabLab by the end of 2017 returning in April 2018.
                    Ever since I’ve been working as a researcher on projects
                    related to the neurorehabilitation of stroke patients.

                  <p>
                    Being a health professional, I am interested in the
                    exploration of novel rehabilitation systems, that can be
                    tailored to be more engaging in aiding the patient on their
                    recovery. It is known that motor imagery (MI) can lead to a
                    new reorganization of neuropaths and promote neuroplasticity
                    in stroke survivors. The use of a new noninvasive biomedical
                    devise for brain motoring, alongside a Virtual environment,
                    can provide a new efficient form of MI training, giving the
                    patient real-time feedback and control over their mental
                    exercise. Refining and studying this method opens a door for
                    the development of a new tool that can work as a complement
                    to the existing conventional therapy techniques.

                    I received my Bachelor of Science in biological engineering
                    with a concentration in medical engineering from Mississippi
                    State University in 2016. I was accepted to a direct-PhD
                    program at Mississippi State University in Computer Science
                    and Engineering. In preparation for graduate school, I
                    completed a substantial amount of coursework in mechanical,
                    electrical, and computer engineering.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In the spring of 2019, I conducted research in the field of
                    brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) at the Technical University
                    of Košice in Slovakia. Since January of 2020, I have been
                    working with the NeuroRehabLab research group at M-ITI in
                    Madeira, Portugal on a project involving the
                    neurorehabilitation of stroke patients using virtual reality
                    (VR) and BCIs While continuing work with the NeuroRehabLab,
                    I am working on my PhD at Mississippi State University in
                    Computer Science and Engineering with a focus in BCIs and
                    human-robot interaction.

                  <p>
                    My specific research interests are BCIs, VR,
                    neurorehabilitation, and human-robot interaction. Having a
                    background in bio-medical engineering, I am looking to
                    combine rehabilitation efforts with advanced technology to
                    improve motor cognition in people suffering from stroke or
                    spinal cord injury. Another area of interest is
                    brain-controlled robotics, prosthetics, and exoskeletons
                    used for therapeutic and rehabilitative purposes. Finding a
                    way to establish a seamless fluidity of control of these
                    tools is something that can have a huge impact on
                    rehabilitation methods. In association with the Social
                    Science Research Center at Mississippi State University, I
                    am helping to advance the use of brain-computer interfaces
                    and machine learning for therapeutic robotic applications.
